# Intermediate SQL 🚀

This folder documents my transition from **beginner SQL to intermediate-level SQL** through hands-on practice and real query writing.

The focus here is not memorization, but understanding **how SQL is used to answer real business questions**.

### 1. Joins
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN

### 2. Union Operations
- UNION
- UNION ALL
- When to use UNION vs JOIN

### 3. String Functions
- UPPER, LOWER
- CONCAT, SUBSTRING
- LENGTH
- REPLACE
- TRIM
- LIKE
- COALESCE

### 4. Subqueries
- Subqueries in WHERE
- Subqueries in SELECT
- Subqueries in FROM
- Breaking complex problems into nested queries

### 5. Window Functions
- ROW_NUMBER
- RANK
- DENSE_RANK
- PARTITION BY
- Ranking and analysis without collapsing rows

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- How data flows through a query step by step
- Why JOIN conditions belong in `ON`, not `WHERE`
- How subqueries execute before the outer query
- The difference between aggregation and window functions
- How to read and reason about complex SQL queries

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Confusion between JOIN types and their outputs
- Understanding subquery execution order
- Differentiating RANK vs DENSE_RANK
- Avoiding aliasing mistakes in multi-table queries

---

## ✅ How I Solved Them

- Practiced on the same tables repeatedly
- Wrote queries incrementally instead of all at once
- Added comments to explain *why* each part exists
- Focused on logic before syntax

---

## 📈 Current Status

I can confidently:
- Combine multiple tables
- Write nested queries
- Perform analytical ranking
- Explain my SQL decisions clearly

Next step: **Advanced SQL (CASE statements, CTEs, advanced window functions)**
