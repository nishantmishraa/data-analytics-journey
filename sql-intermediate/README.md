# Intermediate SQL

This folder contains my **intermediate-level SQL practice**, focused on writing queries that answer real business questions.

The goal here was to move beyond basic SELECT statements and learn how to **combine data, apply logic, analyze results, and think like an analyst**.

## Topics Covered
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Union & Union All
- String functions
- Subqueries
- CASE statements (conditional logic in SQL)
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, PARTITION BY)

## What I Learned
- How different JOIN types affect results
- How to stack and compare datasets using UNION
- How to clean and manipulate text data
- How to break complex problems using subqueries
- How to apply IF–ELSE logic using CASE
- How to rank and analyze data without collapsing rows

## Challenges
- Understanding join behavior
- Visualizing subquery execution
- Differentiating RANK vs DENSE_RANK
- Writing correct CASE conditions

## Outcome
I can confidently write, read, and explain **intermediate SQL queries** and am now preparing to move into **advanced SQL concepts** like CTEs and optimization.

Learning SQL one query at a time.
